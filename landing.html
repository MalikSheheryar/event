            <p>This is a series of experiments trying to design editorial stories in a 3D webspace. Completely digital, my thesis will be presented as a collection of web spaces written with Javascript. The web framework I am using is called A-Frame, which allows for a website to be displayed as a 3D world (WebVR). When I first discovered WebVR last September, it became a design prompt for me to learn about this tool’s potential, and to carve space for it to exist in our current day.</p>
            <p class="text-wrap">
                
                This project had initially been proposed as a quarterly released online publication named EVENT. I envisioned it as a small online event where you could see other users in the same 3D world as you when reading, depicted by simple prisms on the screen to show their location in the 3D webspace. Later in the project, I realized that although this is how I envision my project refined as a whole, I didn’t want to focus on this branding just yet. <img src="/Assets/landing/landtest1.png" alt="Sample Image" class="overflow-image">Instead, I wanted to continue pushing my work with this tool and test different approaches to designing within a 3D webspace. I wanted the project to be focused on the design of each story, rather than the sum of its parts. Thus, I reframed my project into my embarking of designing editorial in a 3D webspace as an amateur coder. My goal is for each story to successfully depart from its 2D counterparts with purpose. I continuously compared various 2D and 3D work, to see what contrasts in benefit each had. What could be remade into 3D and what elements might be better off staying in a 2D canvas.
            </p>
            <p>For example, the biggest and most commonly noted difference is that large pieces of text are generally not encouraged to be placed in 3D settings. It’s simply smoother to read on a flat scrollable plane rather than imposing large chunks of text in a moving world. I think this may have been a large reason as to why 3D world building is yet to be common in the editorial world. There are some easy fixes for this issue, from including a scrollable sidebar for lengthy reading, to adding audio of the transcript, and popup text boxes. All of which I tried in what I believed to be the most suitable for each story.

                However, I think there is something beautiful about the way text can be laid out against an XYZ axis. To me, I felt that it almost changed the context that text could be read in. I started thinking about text as sculptural elements to be put into this world. I thought about essays being formatted as physical structure, walls bounding something. I thought about the ways depth and text could work to create illusions. How a poster could initially look flat, but in reality some of the characters are scaled 3 times larger than another, and yet 3 times farther from the viewer. Just imagining this web experience began altering my brain chemistry of how one could look at type.  It’s like playing with dolls in a doll house but instead it's lines of text speaking to each other, painting the house. The initial altering of brain chemistry I had about type is how I knew I was certain this had to become my thesis project. I have been continuously practicing magazine and creative directing projects for the last four years, however I never managed to push typography in ways I wished. I would continuously second guess my decisions, and whether I knew the rules of typography. But this felt exciting. It felt like I was about to start fresh and learn something familiar yet completely novel to me. Like switching from skiing to snowboarding. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In all honesty, apart from the coding, trying to push the typography in its very own way was the hardest challenge of this entire project. I knew I could make beautiful things on this canvas but I knew I needed reasoning. Some kind of substance for why text should look like that.   
            </p>
            <p>
                Within this project, there are 5 directions I landed on for my explorations in this new medium. The first one is fashion editorials and still life. The advantage for this is that I can play with scaling, repetition, and any location on the map which I wouldn’t really have access to in person. It became sort of like a lego build your own fantasy to me. I could make the 3D assets as big as I wanted and almost any asset I’d like, giving me immense creative freedom. Since there are so many outputs I could make, I wanted to do a handful with the ideas I had in mind. First, I was really inspired by these Prada ads from ____. I loved this sort of utopic/dystopic feeling it evoked from the beautiful clean blue sky and all the models lined together like an army.
